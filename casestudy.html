<h1>CaseStudy for SnowSpirit</h1>
<h5>Original Sketches</h5>
<p>Every design for me starts with my sketchbook. Everything from layouts, sitemaps, and even early wireframes start in my sketchbook.</p>

<h5>Sitemaps</h5>
<p>I like to create a sitemap as soon as I have the idea rolling. It helps me do two things:
    <ol>
        <li>I can easily share this map with others when collaborating to stay on the same             page.</li>
        <li>From this map I can understand what screens need to be built and how they connect to                others.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h5>Wireframes</h5>
<p>Method of choice for me is to use Sketch for all my wireframes both high and low fidelity. I can easily align the wireframes to what I want and then fill in the images and colors straight into the layouts. </p>

<h5>Colors and Fonts</h5>
<p>I used Monteserrat for the titles and Lato for the subtext. Monteserrat is a strong, bold font that promotes the feeling of strength. I wanted the hero to almost be a challenge to the user; inspiring them to climb mountains. Lato is a more easily read text but still in the sans-serif family. The pairing of the two fonts helps with the outdoor/ industrial feel. No glit or glam.</p>
<p>The monochromatic colors of the page tie into the feel of winter. The dark blue anchors the page, and the further softer blues don't distract the user from the product.</p>

<h5>Final Product</h5>
<p>My method of creating the final product is using a combination of Illustrator and Photoshop to build the content then push them into Sketch which I can easily manipulate.  I then would upload the screens onto Invision where I could build the prototype and work out any design flaws or problems. </p>
